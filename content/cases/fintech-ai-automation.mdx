# FinTech AI Automation

## Challenge

A leading financial services company was spending 40+ hours per week manually processing transaction data, reconciling accounts, and generating compliance reports. The process was error-prone and prevented the team from focusing on strategic work.

## Solution

Max Motion built a custom AI workflow that:

- Automated data extraction from multiple sources
- Performed intelligent reconciliation with anomaly detection
- Generated compliance-ready reports with audit trails
- Integrated seamlessly with existing systems

## Results

**70% reduction in manual processing time**  
What took 40 hours now takes 12 hours, freeing the team to focus on analysis and strategy.

**85% fewer errors**  
AI-powered validation catches issues before they become problems.

**3-month ROI**  
The efficiency gains paid for the project in the first quarter.
